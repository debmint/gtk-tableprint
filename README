This is a library to add the ability to print hardcopy reports in
tabular form.  It will do the calculations for print position and
do the rendering.  In order to do so, the formatting will need to
be passed to the library in the form of an xml document, which can
either be embedded in the program or read from an external file.
Please point your browser to the documentation in the subdirectory
of this distribution
           docs/reference/html/index.html
for details of the format for this xml data.

The data is read from a PostGreSQL database using a provided query.

This library implements GObject-Introspetion, and so it can be used
by any programming language that supports GObject-Introspection.

INSTALLATION NOTES

Please read the file "INSTALL" for general instructions on how to
build and install the program.  In addition to the instructions in
that file whey you run "./configure", you need to include the option

                          --enable-gtk-doc

to enable the building of the Gtk Documentation, as this feature is
disabled by default.
